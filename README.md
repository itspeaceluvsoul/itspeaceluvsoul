> 🧠💻 Self-taught. Soul-driven. Pixel-perfect.

I'm **Peace**, also known as **@itspeaceluvsoul**. I'm a passionate designer and digital artist, blending thoughtful creativity with clean, functional design. I honor my Kenyan roots while building experiences that feel natural, intuitive, and grounded. 💚

- 🎨 Artist with a sharp eye for detail and love for Afro-aesthetics
- 💡 Early adopter of AI in design workflows — been building with it since it hit the public
- 🧘🏾‍♀️ Centered in peace, purpose, and pixels

### 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, a lil’ JS magic ✨
- **AI Tools:** ChatGPT, RunwayML, Leonardo, Dall-E, and more

### 💚 My Vibe
Minimalist meets Kenyan chic — clean grids, earthy tones, and a sprinkle of glow. Inspired by nature, culture, and the divine feminine. Soft edges, bold visions. UI that feels like home.
